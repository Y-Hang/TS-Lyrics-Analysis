# Taylor Swift Lyrics Anlysis: *From Country Love Story to Pop Bad Blood*

With AMA's **Artist of the Decade**, Billboard's **Women of the Decade**, CMA's **Pinnacle Award**, and 2 wins of Grammy's **Album of the Year**, Taylor Swift is undoubtedly one of the most successful artists of the 2010s decade. Interestingly, Taylor debuted as a country singer and pocketed her first Grammy Album of the Year with country album *Fearless*. Then her career gradually shifted towards pop music and she crowned herself a second Grammy Album of the Year with pop ablum *1989*. Massive media coverage of Taylor's success in both country and pop music almost makes this topic a cliche, but the lyrics of her songs can provide us with a more detailed and unmediated perspective to observe the evolution of this country-to-pop crossover princess.

This project analyzed the lyrics of songs in Taylor Swift's 7 studio albums (From self-titled album to newest album Lover).
